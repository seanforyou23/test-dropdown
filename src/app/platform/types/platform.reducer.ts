/**
 * PlatformStore defines the contract scheme for the overall application store,
 * available to all feature domains, either eagerly or lazy loaded. For each
 * new slice of state defined at @syndesis/ui/platform, add the corresponding
 * state key and its interface type at PlatformStore, plus the same state key
 * associated to its particular reducer. This reducer will be made available
 * later to lazy loaded modules within their own fractal state store thru
 * store composition, store inheritance and custom feature selectors.
